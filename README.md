# ML-models

This project, completed for a university class, involves implementing various learning models for both classification and regression problems. These models are trained and tested on a dataset containing information about individuals' characteristics and their health habits. For regression problems, the models predict weights, while for classification tasks, they determine whether individuals are obese or not.
